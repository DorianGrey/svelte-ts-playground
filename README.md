# Svelte TS playground

Just a playground app tot figure out how good Svelte works in conjunction with TypeScript already...


# Known issues

- ESLint in `.svelte` files does not work in conjunction with TypeScript yet, since a preprocessor is required. See https://github.com/sveltejs/eslint-plugin-svelte3/pull/62<br>As such, `eslint-plugin-svelte3` will not be used for now.
